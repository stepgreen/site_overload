Description:
    Creates an overloaded site instance. It will create a db migration to add the site details to Site. Make sure that after adding a site you 
    modify the created migration to set the FQDs (Fully Qualified Domains) correctly for each environment.
    
    To properly test a site locally, you may need to update your hosts file to include the FQD for the development environment.
    The convention used for development/local FQDs is that they end in .dev

Example:
    ./script/generate site_overload Thing

    This will create:
    	db/migrate/SiteDataMigration
        sites/
        sites/Thing
        sites/Thing/app/
        sites/Thing/app/views
        sites/Thing/app/views/layouts
        sites/Thing/public/
        sites/Thing/public/images
        sites/Thing/public/javascript
        sites/Thing/public/stylesheets
